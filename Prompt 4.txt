Prompt 4: Here is an introduction to K’iche’ grammar on intransitive and transitive verb conjugations. Following this prompt, I will provide an assessment for you to complete using this information.


# K'iche' Grammar and Verbal Morphology: ML Training Specification


## Core Language Classification
- Language Family: Eastern Mayan
- Subfamily: Quichean-Mamean
- Alignment System: Ergative-absolutive
- Morphological Type: Head-marking
- Primary Word Order: VOS


## Fundamental Components


### Pronominal System
1. Set A (Ergative) Pronouns
```
Environment: Prevocalic
1SG: w/inw
2SG: aw
3SG: r
1PL: q
2PL: iw
3PL: k


Environment: Preconsonantal
1SG: in
2SG: a
3SG: u
1PL: qa
2PL: i
3PL: ki
```


2. Set B (Absolutive) Pronouns
```
1SG: in
2SG: at
3SG: ∅ (null morpheme)
1PL: oj
2PL: ix
3PL: e
```


### Aspect Markers
```
Incompletive: K- or Ka- (present/future/habitual)
if: no vowel between marker and verb or first pronoun,
then: use Ka,
else: use K
Completive: X- (past/completed)
Position: Always word-initial
```


## Verb Classification System


### 1. Intransitive Verbs
- Valency: Monovalent (one argument)
- Template: `Aspect-SetB-VerbRoot-(PFM)`
- Phrase Final Marker (PFM): -(i)k
- Example Set:
```
B'e(k) = go
Chakun(ik) = work
Kowin(ik) = be_able
Wa'(ik) = eat
Tak'i(k) = stand_up
```


### 2. Transitive Verbs
- Valency: Bivalent (two arguments)
- Template: `Aspect-SetB-SetA-VerbRoot-(PFM)`


#### Subclassification:
1. Derived Transitives
```
Properties:
- Ends in -j
- No phrase final marker
- Often derived from other word classes


Lexicon:
B'ij = say
Elesaj = remove
Solij = visit
Tzukuj = search_for
Tz'ib'aj = write
```


2. Root Transitives
```
Properties:
- CVC structure
- Takes vocalic PFM (o/u)
- Primary transitive concepts


Lexicon:
Il(o) = see
K'ut(u) = teach
Loq'(o) = buy
To'(o) = help
Ya'(o) = give
```


## Processing Rules for ML Implementation


### Verb Construction Algorithm:
1. Identify verb type (transitive/intransitive)
2. Select appropriate template
3. Insert aspect marker (K/Ka/X)
4. Insert pronouns based on:
   - For intransitive: Insert Set B for subject
   - For transitive: Insert Set B for object, Set A for subject
5. Apply morphophonological rules:
   - Use prevocalic Set A before vowels
   - Use preconsonantal Set A before consonants
6. Add phrase final marker if:
   - Verb is phrase-final AND
   - Verb is intransitive (-ik/-k) OR root transitive (-o/-u)


### Validation Rules:
1. Verify verb type matches pronoun arrangement
2. Check for valid aspect marker
3. Ensure proper pronoun selection based on phonological environment
4. Validate phrase final marker presence/absence
5. Confirm morpheme order follows template


### Error Handling:
1. Invalid pronoun combinations
2. Incorrect aspect marker placement
3. Wrong template application
4. Inappropriate phrase final marker usage
5. Morphophonological rule violations


## Training Considerations
- Prioritize template adherence
- Enforce strict morpheme ordering
- Validate morphophonological rules
- Check for proper argument structure
- Verify alignment system consistency
- Monitor phrase final marker distribution
- Track pronoun set selection accuracy
- Ensure aspect marker placement
- Validate verb type classification
- Check derivational patterns
